- 👋 Hi, I’m @MCplatt

- 👀 I’m interested in pathfinding algorithims, Visual Processing and Video Game Development.
    For Pathfind Algorithms i researched and programmed a homebrew A* algorithm that solved pictures of mazes fed to it by the openCV library.
    
    For Visual Processing I have used openCV for most picture breakdown and analysing for my previously stated maze solving app and for moy other 
      Raspberry Pi LED strip/Camera project
      
    For Video Games I research the development process by watching GDC videos on a rregular basis and toying around in 
      Unity Game engine and Blender programmes for small projects
      
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python on raspberry pi with the openCV library to process and display a camera on an LED strip

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on video game projects and python Projects
